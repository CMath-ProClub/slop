# Video Processing Guide

## üé¨ How Video Generation Works

### The Reality Check

When you search for "Family Guy" or any TV show/movie in our system, **no actual video file is automatically downloaded or generated**. Here's why:

### Why Can't We Auto-Download Videos?

1. **Copyright Protection**: TV shows and movies are protected intellectual property
2. **Streaming Service Terms**: Services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ prohibit automated downloads
3. **Authentication Required**: Each service requires user login and doesn't provide APIs for video downloads
4. **Legal Constraints**: Automated downloading would violate DMCA and other copyright laws

## ‚úÖ What DOES Work

### Option 1: Upload Your Own Videos (Recommended)

The video processing system **fully works** when you provide your own video files!

**What the system will do:**
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Convert any video to vertical format (9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok/Shorts)
- üéØ Crop and center the video intelligently
- üìù Auto-generate captions using OpenAI Whisper AI
- ‚è±Ô∏è Trim to your desired length (15-180 seconds)
- üé® Optimize bitrate and quality for social media
- üì§ Prepare for direct upload to YouTube Shorts or TikTok

**How to use:**
1. Go to "Create Clip" page
2. Choose "Upload Video" option
3. Select your video file (any format: MP4, MOV, AVI, etc.)
4. Configure length and caption settings
5. Click "Upload & Process"
6. Download your processed vertical clip!

### Option 2: Browse Library + Manual Video

If you want to create clips from specific TV shows/movies:

1. **Browse the library** to find the show/movie you want
2. **Manually obtain** the video file:
   - Screen record from your streaming service (legal for personal use)
   - Use your own recorded content
   - Purchase/download from legitimate sources
3. **Upload the video** using our upload feature
4. **Process** it with our automated tools

## üõ†Ô∏è What Gets Processed

When you upload a video, here's what happens behind the scenes:

### Step 1: Video Analysis
```python
# FFmpeg analyzes the video
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (or whatever you provide)
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (horizontal)
- Duration: 25 minutes
- Audio: Present
```

### Step 2: Vertical Conversion
```python
# Converts to 9:16 for mobile
- New Resolution: 1080x1920 (vertical)
- Crops intelligently (keeps center/action)
- Maintains quality: 4Mbps video, 192kbps audio
```

### Step 3: Caption Generation
```python
# OpenAI Whisper transcribes audio
- Extracts speech to text
- Adds timestamps
- Formats as SRT subtitles
- Burns captions into video
```

### Step 4: Optimization
```python
# Prepares for social media
- Trims to desired length
- Optimizes file size
- Adds proper metadata
- Exports as MP4
```

## üìä Example Workflow

### Creating a Family Guy Clip (Real Process):

1. **Find Content**: Search "Family Guy" in our library ‚úÖ
2. **Get Episode**: 
   - Option A: Screen record from Hulu
   - Option B: Use a clip you already have
   - Option C: Use legally downloaded content
3. **Upload**: Use our "Upload Video" feature ‚úÖ
4. **Configure**: Set length to 60 seconds, enable captions ‚úÖ
5. **Process**: System converts to vertical, adds captions ‚úÖ
6. **Download**: Get your TikTok-ready clip! ‚úÖ
7. **Upload**: Use built-in YouTube/TikTok upload buttons ‚úÖ

## üé• Supported Video Formats

**Input formats (we can process):**
- MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM, FLV
- Any resolution (will convert to 1080x1920)
- Any aspect ratio (will crop to 9:16)
- With or without audio

**Output format:**
- MP4 (H.264 video codec)
- 1080x1920 resolution (9:16 vertical)
- 4Mbps video bitrate
- 192kbps audio bitrate
- Optimized for TikTok and YouTube Shorts

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Video Quality
- **Use high-resolution source** (1080p or higher recommended)
- **Avoid heavily compressed** videos
- **Check center framing** - our crop focuses on the center

### Audio/Captions
- **Clear audio** = better caption accuracy
- **English audio** works best (Whisper supports 90+ languages)
- **Background music** is preserved

### Length
- **TikTok**: 15-60 seconds (sweet spot: 30-45s)
- **YouTube Shorts**: up to 60 seconds
- **Instagram Reels**: 15-90 seconds
