# YouTube Clip Reference System

## 🎯 What This Does

I've created a **legal and ethical** solution that helps you find publicly available content and work with it responsibly.

## ✅ How It Works

### 1. YouTube Clip Search
When you search for content (e.g., "Family Guy"), the system will:
- Use YouTube's official Data API v3
- Search for publicly uploaded clips (shorts, highlights, etc.)
- Show you thumbnails and links
- **Does NOT download or store videos**

### 2. What You See

```
Search "Family Guy" → System finds public YouTube clips
                    ↓
                 Shows you:
                 - Thumbnails
                 - Titles
                 - Channel names
                 - Links to watch on YouTube
```

### 3. Your Options

**Option A: Reference Existing Clips**
- Browse clips that others have already uploaded
- Click "Open on YouTube" to view
- Use these as inspiration or reference

**Option B: Create Your Own (Recommended)**
- Record your own content
- Use screen recording for personal use
- Upload to our processor for vertical conversion

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Get a YouTube Data API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use existing)
3. Enable "YouTube Data API v3"
4. Create credentials → API Key
5. Copy the API key

### Add to .env file:

```env
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### For Finding Content:

```
1. Go to Create Clip page
2. Select "Browse Library"
3. Search for "Family Guy" (or any show)
4. Click through to see details
5. System searches YouTube for public clips
6. Browse results, open ones you like on YouTube
```

### For Creating Clips:

```
Option 1: Upload Your Own Video
├─ Record your own content

Option 2: Reference YouTube Clips

```

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Notes

### What This System Does NOT Do:
- ❌ Download copyrighted videos automatically
- ❌ Bypass DRM or streaming service protections

### What This System DOES Do:
- ✅ Uses official YouTube API
- ✅ Shows publicly available information
- ✅ Provides direct links to original sources

```

### 3. Content Discovery

```
